# Job state

<CH.Scrollycoding>

## Owner side

1. An owner creates a job with an execute message, conditions, and a reward. Upon successful creation, the job enters the [_`Pending`_ status.](focus://2)
2. While in the _`Pending`_ state, an owner can [update](focus://7:9) a job's message or increase the reward amount of the job.
3. Owners can also [delete a job while in the _`Pending`_ state. When a job is deleted, its state becomes _`Cancelled`_.](focus://10[17:39],11[17:39],12[38:39],13[38:39],14[33:44],15[33:44],16[33:44])

```rust Job-Status

## Keeper side


4. A keeper can attempt to execute any job with a [_`Pending`_](focus://7:9) status if they believe the job's conditions have been met. 
5. If the job's conditions aren't yet met, the job remains in the queue, and its status is unchanged. 
6. [Evictors](./overview.mdx#eviction) will collect _`0.01`_ Luna from a job in the queue every 24 hours from the creator's Warp account. If the account cannot pay, the job becomes [_`Evicted`_](focus://14[22:31],15[6:31],16[22:31]), and the eviction fee is taken from the reward. The rest of the reward is refunded to the creator. 
7. If a job fails during execution, its status becomes [_`Failed`_](focus://20[22:30],21[22:30],22[22:30]). 
8. If the job's conditions are met, the job's execute message gets sent, and the rewards included for executing the job are sent to the keeper. The job's status becomes [_`Executed`_](focus://23[7:17],24[7:17],25[7:17]).
