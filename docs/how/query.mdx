# Writing query expressions

This section details query expressions and their structure. For general information on writing conditions, visit the [Conditions and expressions](./condition.mdx) page. To view an example of a query expression, visit the [Example page](../example.mdx)

Query expressions are expressions that select a value from a query message. The structure of a _`QueryExpr`_ contains [a selector](#selectors), a [query request](#query-request), and a name. Any [type of query supported by Cosmos](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/enum.QueryRequest.html) can be used in a condition. 



  
Query expressions can be used as one or both of the values in a [general expression](./condition.mdx#general-expressions), or in [boolean expressions](condition.mdx#bool). When query expressions are used in a condition, the JSON of a query message is sent out, and the value specified by the [selector string](#selectors) is returned as the value to be compared in the [general expression](./condition.mdx#general-expressions). 

```rust condition.rs
pub struct QueryExpr {
    pub selector: String,
    pub query: QueryRequest<String>,
    pub name: String,
}

```




## QueryRequest

Warp conditions support any query type available using the _`QueryRequest`_ struct, which outlines all possible query calls. The possible query types are _`Bank`_, _`Custom`_, _`Staking`_, _`Stargate`_, _`IBC`_, and _`Wasm`_. 

```rust warp_controller.s
pub enum QueryRequest<C> {
    Bank(BankQuery),
    Custom(C),
    #[cfg(feature = "staking")]
    Staking(StakingQuery),
    /// A Stargate query is encoded the same way as abci_query, with path and protobuf encoded request data.
    /// The format is defined in [ADR-21](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/docs/architecture/adr-021-protobuf-query-encoding.md).
    /// The response is protobuf encoded data directly without a JSON response wrapper.
    /// The caller is responsible for compiling the proper protobuf definitions for both requests and responses.
    #[cfg(feature = "stargate")]
    Stargate {
        /// this is the fully qualified service path used for routing,
        /// eg. custom/cosmos_sdk.x.bank.v1.Query/QueryBalance
        path: String,
        /// this is the expected protobuf message type (not any), binary encoded
        data: Binary,
    },
    #[cfg(feature = "stargate")]
    Ibc(IbcQuery),
    Wasm(WasmQuery),
}
```


## Bank Queries


Bank queries are used to query information from the Cosmos bank module. 

```rust bank.rs
pub enum BankQuery {
    /// This calls into the native bank module for querying the total supply of one denomination.
    /// It does the same as the SupplyOf call in Cosmos SDK's RPC API.
    /// Return value is of type SupplyResponse.
    #[cfg(feature = "cosmwasm_1_1")]
    Supply { denom: String },
    /// This calls into the native bank module for one denomination
    /// Return value is BalanceResponse
    Balance { address: String, denom: String },
    /// This calls into the native bank module for all denominations.
    /// Note that this may be much more expensive than Balance and should be avoided if possible.
    /// Return value is AllBalanceResponse.
    AllBalances { address: String },
}
```

### Supply

Returns the total supply of a denomination. 

<CH.Code>

```js JSON 
{
  "bank": {
    "supply": {
      "demom": "<String>"
    }
  }
}
```
---
```js Response 
{
  "supply": [
    {
      "denom": "uluna",
      "amount": "266507"
    }
  ]
}

```
</CH.Code>


### Balance

Queries the amount of a specific denomination for an address. 

<CH.Code>
```js JSON 
{
  "bank": {
    "balance": {
      "address": "<String>", 
        "denom": "<String>"
    }
  }
}

```
---
```js Response 
{
  "amount": [
    {
      "denom": "uluna",
      "amount": "266507"
    }
  ]
}

```
</CH.Code>


### AllBalances

This query calls into the native bank module for all denominations. Note that this may be much more expensive than Balance and should be avoided if possible. The return value is AllBalanceResponse.

<CH.Code>
```js JSON 
{
  "bank": {
    "all_balances": {
      "address": "<String>"
    }
  }
}
```
---
```js Response 
{
  "all_balances": [
    {
      "denom": "uluna",
      "amount": "266507"
    }
  ]
}
```
</CH.Code>


## Staking Queries


Staking queries are used to query information from the Cosmos staking module. 

```rust bank.rs
pub enum StakingQuery {
    /// Returns the denomination that can be bonded (if there are multiple native tokens on the chain)
    BondedDenom {},
    /// AllDelegations will return all delegations by the delegator
    AllDelegations { delegator: String },
    /// Delegation will return more detailed info on a particular
    /// delegation, defined by delegator/validator pair
    Delegation {
        delegator: String,
        validator: String,
    },
    /// Returns all validators in the currently active validator set.
    ///
    /// The query response type is `AllValidatorsResponse`.
    AllValidators {},
    /// Returns the validator at the given address. Returns None if the validator is
    /// not part of the currently active validator set.
    ///
    /// The query response type is `ValidatorResponse`.
    Validator {
        /// The validator's address (e.g. (e.g. cosmosvaloper1...))
        address: String,
    },
}
```

### BondedDenom

Returns all bonded denominations. Terra only uses _`uluna`_. 

<CH.Code>
```js JSON 
{
  "staking": {
    "bonded_denom": {}
  }
}
```
---
```js Response 
{
  "denom": "uluna"
}
```
</CH.Code>


### AllDelegations

Returns all delegations of a delegator. 

<CH.Code>
```js JSON 
{
  "staking": {
    "all_delegations": {
      "delegator": "<terra_address>"
    }
  }
}
```
---
```js Response 

{
  "delegations": [
    {
      "delegator": "<terra_address>",
      "validator": "<terravaloper_address>",
      "amount": {
        "denom": "uluna",
        "amount": "190886529"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
</CH.Code>


### Delegation

{
  "staking": {
    "delegation": {
      "delegator": "<terra_address>",
      "validator": "<terravaloper_address>"
    }
  }
}
```
---
```js Response 
{
  "delegation": {
    "delegator": "<terra_address>",
    "validator": "<terravaloper_address>",
    "amount": {
      "denom": "uluna",
      "amount": "190886529"
    },
    "accumulated_rewards": [
      {
        "denom": "uluna",
        "amount": "14323941"
      }
    ],
    "can_redelegate": {
      "denom": "uluna",
      "amount": "190886529"
    }
  }
}
```
</CH.Code>


### AllValidators

Returns the entire active validator set. 

<CH.Code>
```js JSON 
{
  "staking": {
    "all_validators": {}
  }
}
```
---
```js Response 
{
  "validators": [
    {
      "address": "<terravaloper_address>",
      "commission": "0.000000000000000000",
      "max_commission": "0.200000000000000000",
      "max_change_rate": "0.010000000000000000"
    },
    {
      "address": "<terravaloper_address>",
      "commission": "0.050000000000000000",
      "max_commission": "0.100000000000000000",
      "max_change_rate": "0.010000000000000000"
    },

    ...

  ]
}
```
</CH.Code>


### Validator

Returns the validator at the given address.

<CH.Code>
```js JSON 
{
  "staking": {
    "validator": {
        "address": "<String>"
    }
  }
}
```
---
```js Response 
{
  "validator": {
    "address": "<terravaloper_address>",
    "commission": "0.050000000000000000",
    "max_commission": "0.200000000000000000",
    "max_change_rate": "0.200000000000000000"
  }
}
```
</CH.Code>

## Wasm Queries

Wasm queries are used to query information from the Cosmos Wasm module. For WASM queries, you **must** know the format of your Response.

```rust wasm.rs
pub enum WasmQuery {
    /// this queries the public API of another contract at a known address (with known ABI)
    /// Return value is whatever the contract returns (caller should know), wrapped in a
    /// ContractResult that is JSON encoded.
    Smart {
        contract_addr: String,
        /// msg is the json-encoded QueryMsg struct
        msg: Binary,
    },
    /// this queries the raw kv-store of the contract.
    /// returns the raw, unparsed data stored at that key, which may be an empty vector if not present
    Raw {
        contract_addr: String,
        /// Key is the raw key used in the contracts Storage
        key: Binary,
    },
    /// returns a ContractInfoResponse with metadata on the contract from the runtime
    ContractInfo { contract_addr: String },
}
```


### Smart

Queries the public API of another contract at a known address (with known ABI). The return value is wrapped in a ContractResult that is JSON encoded. The _`msg`_ is the json-encoded _`QueryMsg`_ struct.

```js JSON 
{
  "wasm": {
    "smart": {
      "contract_addr": "<String>",
          "msg": "<Binary>"
    }
  }
}

```



### Raw

Queries the raw kv-store of the contract. Returns the raw, unparsed data stored at that key, which may be an empty vector if not present. 


```js JSON 
{
  "wasm": {
    "raw": {
      "contract_addr": "<String>",
          "key": "<Binary>"
    }
  }
}
```


### ContractInfo

Returns a _`ContractInfoResponse`_ with metadata on the contract from the runtime

<CH.Code>

```js JSON 
{
  "wasm": {
    "raw": {
      "contract_info": {
          "contract_addr": "<String>"
      }
    }
  }
}

```
---
```rust wasm.rs 
pub struct ContractInfoResponse {
    pub code_id: u64,
    /// address that instantiated this contract
    pub creator: String,
    /// admin who can run migrations (if any)
    pub admin: Option<String>,
    /// if set, the contract is pinned to the cache, and thus uses less gas when called
    pub pinned: bool,
    /// set if this contract has bound an IBC port
    pub ibc_port: Option<String>,
}

impl ContractInfoResponse {
    /// Convenience constructor for tests / mocks
    #[doc(hidden)]
    pub fn new(code_id: u64, creator: impl Into<String>) -> Self {
        Self {
            code_id,
            creator: creator.into(),
            admin: None,
            pinned: false,
            ibc_port: None,
        }
    }
}
```

</CH.Code>




## Selectors

Selector strings are used in query expressions to select the JSON path of the query response. You can think of a selector string as the path that Warp needs to take within that particular query response to get the value that needs comparing. 

**Example**:

To select _`"bend"`_ as the desired portion of the query response below, the _`$.address.city`_ selector is used. The _`$`_ in the selector refers to the root object/element. 

```javascript example.json
{
  "address": {
          "streetAddress": "high street",
          "city": "bend",
          "postalCode": "97701"
  }
}
```
