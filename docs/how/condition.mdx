# Conditions and expressions

Conditions represent event definitions, and they outline the circumstances under which a job can be completed. A condition is a recursive data type that allows for multiple conditions within it, all of which need to resolve to true for the Job to allow execution. This complex data type includes several underlying types. For more general information on conditions, visit the [concepts section](overview.mdx#conditions). To view an example of a condition, visit the [Example page](../guides/example.mdx). For information about conditions in templates, visit the [template tutorial](../guides/template.mdx). 


Conditions can be either a single expression, or they can be nested and chained using regular boolean operators, such as `And`, `Or`, or `Not`. 

```rust condition.rs
pub enum Condition {
    And(Vec<Box<Condition>>),
    Or(Vec<Box<Condition>>),
    Not(Box<Condition>),
    Expr(Box<Expr>),
}
```


## Expressions

Expressions contain comparisons of popular data types, such as integers, unsigned integers, timestamps, booleans, strings, and more.

```rust condition.rs
pub enum Expr {
    String(GenExpr<Value<String>, StringOp>),
    Uint(GenExpr<NumValue<Uint256, NumExprOp, IntFnOp>, NumOp>),
    Int(GenExpr<NumValue<i128, NumExprOp, IntFnOp>, NumOp>),
    Decimal(GenExpr<NumValue<Decimal256, NumExprOp, DecimalFnOp>, NumOp>),
    Timestamp(TimeExpr),
    BlockHeight(BlockExpr),
    Bool(String),
}
```

## Values

A value is the simplest type of input used in an expression. In double-sided [general expressions](#general-expressions), the value can either be a primitive type or a query that gets a primitive type.

```rust condition.rs
pub enum Value<T> {
    Simple(T),
    Ref(String),
}
```

### NumValue

`NumValue` represents a numeric value that can be used in an expression with several variants:

```rust condition.rs
pub enum NumValue<T, ExprOp, FnOp> {
    Simple(T),
    Expr(NumExprValue<T, ExprOp, FnOp>),
    Ref(String),
    Fn(NumFnValue<T, ExprOp, FnOp>),
    Env(NumEnvValue),
}

pub enum NumEnvValue {
    Time,
    BlockHeight,
}
```

- `Simple(T)`: a simple numeric value.
- `Expr(NumExprValue<T, ExprOp, FnOp>)`: a numeric expression that can be evaluated to a numeric value. It contains a `NumExprValue` struct that has a left operand, an operator, and a right operand.
- `Ref(String)`: represents a reference to a numeric value stored elsewhere.
- `Fn(NumFnValue<T, ExprOp, FnOp>)`: represents a function that takes a numeric value as input and returns a numeric value as output. It contains a `NumFnValue` struct that has an operator and a right operand.
- `Env(NumEnvValue)`: represents a special numeric value that is derived from the environment, such as the current block height or timestamp. It contains a `NumEnvValue` enum that specifies the type of environment value.


## General expressions

<CH.Scrollycoding>

General expressions or _`GenExpr`_ are used to compare two values using a:

- [_`left:`_](focus://2) value, 
- an operator [_`op:`_](focus://3), 
- and a [_`right:`_](focus://4) value. 

The operators of general expressions vary depending on the value type. 

```rust condition.rs
pub struct GenExpr<Type, Op> {
    pub left: Type,
    pub op: Op,
    pub right: Type,
}
```

</ CH.Scrollycoding>

<Admonition type="tip" icon="âœ…" title="Comparing values">

Only values of the same _`Type`_ can be compared when writing an expression.

### String operators

The following operators are used in general expressions when comparing strings. 

```rust condition.rs
#[cw_serde]
pub enum StringOp {
    StartsWith,
    EndsWith,
    Contains,
    Eq,
    Neq,
}
```

### Number operators

The following operators are used in general expressions when comparing integers or decimals. 

```rust condition.rs
#[cw_serde]
pub enum NumOp {
    Eq,
    Neq,
    Lt,
    Gt,
    Gte,
    Lte,
}
```

## Time expressions

Time expressions are like regular unsigned integer expressions, except they only contain a left value and an operator. The right value is filled by a _`BlockHeight`_ or _`Timestamp`_, depending on the value type.

```rust condition.rs
pub struct TimeExpr {
    pub comparator: Uint64,
    pub op: TimeOp,
}
```

### Time operators

Time operators can be greater than or less than a specified time. 

```rust condition.rs
pub enum TimeOp {
    Lt,
    Gt,
}
```

### Block expressions

Blockheights can be specified as a _`Unit64`_ and a [number operator](#number-operators). 

```rust condition.rs
pub struct BlockExpr {
    pub comparator: Uint64,
    pub op: NumOp,
}
```


## Queries

In addition to being used directly in expressions, queries can also be used as variables in the `Condition` and `Expr`. This allows for more complex expressions that can dynamically reference and compare different types of data. For more information on queries, visit the [Query page](./query.mdx).

### Bool

Queries can also be written as boolean expressions, in which a [query selector](./query.mdx#selectors) is evaluated as a boolean.
