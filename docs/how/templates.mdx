# Templates

Templates allow job and condition logic to be generalized and reused. Combined with variables, templates make complex jobs and conditions easy for any user. Templates are written to the blockchain upon their creation and can be accessed by users looking to perform tasks. To learn how to create a template, follow the [Template tutorial](../guides/template.mdx).
