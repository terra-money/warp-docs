# Fees

All fees collected by Warp are swapped to Luna and burned. They are estimated based on 3 factors: A creation fee based on the queue size, a maintenance fee based on the job duration, and a burn fee based on the reward amount. In addition to fees, a reward also needs to be provided to pay the keeper. Fees and a reward are paid up-front on all jobs. Fees for recurring jobs are estimated and set based on the duration of the job, which is configured during job creation. 

### Creation Fee

The creation fee (`f(qs)`) is a piecewise function depending on the queue size (`qs`). It is incurred when a job is created. 

```
f(qs) = 
  y1, if qs < x1
  slope * qs + y1 - slope * x1, if x1 <= qs < x2
  y2, if qs >= x2
```

Where:
- `x1` = `config.queue_size_left`
- `x2` = `config.queue_size_right`
- `y1` = `config.creation_fee_min`
- `y2` = `config.creation_fee_max`
- `slope` = `(y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)`

### Maintenance Fee

The maintenance fee (`g(dd)`) is structured similarly to the creation fee, and it is based on the duration in days (`dd`).

```
g(dd) = 
  y1, if dd < x1
  slope * dd + y1 - slope * x1, if x1 <= dd < x2
  y2, if dd >= x2
```

Where:
- `x1` = `config.duration_days_min`
- `x2` = `config.duration_days_max`
- `slope` = `(y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)`

### Burn Fee

The burn fee (`h(job_reward)`) is calculated as the maximum between the `calculated_fee` and `min_fee`.

```
h(job_reward) = 
  max(calculated_fee, min_fee)
```

Where:
- `calculated_fee` = `job_reward * config.burn_fee_rate / 100`
- `min_fee` = `config.burn_fee_min`
