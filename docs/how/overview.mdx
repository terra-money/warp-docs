# Overview

The following section is a basic overview of how Warp works. For a more in-depth look at Warp smart contracts, visit the [Contracts](../contracts/messages) section. To learn how to use Warp, visit the [Get started](../get-started.mdx) tutorial. 

## Jobs

Jobs are the main feature of Warp. Users submit WASM messages along with specified [conditions](#conditions) and a reward. When the conditions are met, [keepers](#keepers) send the message and receive the reward. Jobs can contain any valid WASM messages, including other _`create_job`_ transactions, allowing jobs to be chained together and executed from the same context.

When a job is created, users must specify a job name, a reward amount, an execute message, and a contract address for the message. The job message is signed by the owner at the time of job creation, to be executed later by keepers. 

Any tokens sent as part of a job's message must be present in the user's [Warp account](#account) balance at the moment of execution.

```rust
pub struct Job {
  // unique identifier for each Job
  pub id: Uint64,
  // job creator address
  pub owner: Addr,
  // UTC timestamp for when the job was submitted
  pub last_update_time: Uint64,
  // name given to the Job
  pub name: String,
  // status of the job (pending, executed, failed, canceled)
  pub status: JobStatus,
  // condition set dictating when the Job should be executed
  pub condition: Condition,
  // message to execute when conditions resolve to true
  pub msg: Vec<CosmosMsg>,
  // reward to distribute to the keeper when the Job has been executed
  pub reward: Uint128,
}
```

To learn more about the workflow of jobs, visit the [Job state](./state.mdx) page. To learn about creating a job template, visit the [Template tutorial](../guides/template.mdx).

## Conditions

Each job must be submitted with conditions, which are a set of circumstances under which the job should be executed. Conditions are made up of expressions which can be simple, such as specifying a blockheight, or complex, in which multiple conditions are nested and joined using boolean operators. Query responses can also be used in expressions to specify a condition. When all the expressions in a condition evaluate to _`true`_, the condition is met, and the job can be completed. 

To learn more about how conditions work, visit the [Conditions page](./condition.mdx).

## Templates and variables

[Templates](./templates.mdx) and [variables](./variables.mdx) allow Warp users to create reusable, looping jobs. Templates create a job structure, and they contain variables that can be [updated by a user](../get-started.mdx#create-a-job-using-a-premade-template). They can also be specified to update automatically through [looping](./variables.mdx#update-functions-and-loops). To learn how to create variables and job templates, follow the [Template tutorial](../guides/template.mdx). 

## Warp accounts

In order to transact funds, a job must have access to a wallet. Warp accounts are smart contract wallets that allow users to transact with Warp. Warp accounts function similarly to a Cosmos wallet account. For example, users can use their account to send, deposit, delegate, undelegate, or receive funds by interacting with their accounts as a smart contract. Using the Warp app, users can deposit or withdraw funds from their Warp accounts. Any transactions using jobs are executed through a user's account. Warp accounts can only be controlled by a user's wallet and the jobs that they create. 

## The queue

Jobs that have been successfully created by a user are added to a queue, where they will remain until their conditions are met and they are executed by a [keeper](#keepers). 

```rust
pub enum JobStatus {
    Pending,
    Executed,
    Failed,
    Cancelled,
}
```

For more on job state, the queue, and a basic workflow, visit the [Job state page](./state.mdx).

## Keepers

A keeper is any party that maintains the automation functions of a smart contract. Keepers are incentivized by Warp users to execute smart contract functions on their behalf, in exchange for a reward. Keepers query the chain and evaluate a job's condition. Once the conditions for a job are met, a keeper can submit the execute message contained in the job. To learn how to run a keeper, visit the [Keeper guide](../guides/keeper.mdx)

## Rewards 

Rewards are given by job owners to keepers in exchange for executing their jobs. Because Warp is a decentralized event handler, rewards are an incentive for unknown keepers to execute jobs, without the need for a centralized intermediary. There is no set price for rewards. Rewards are provided in Luna and are priced organically, based on computing power costs and incentives for the keeper. 

## Example

The following illustration demonstrates how a job is executed.
