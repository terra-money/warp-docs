# Warp app tutorial

Follow this guide to create an account and start writing jobs and conditions. For more general information on how Warp works, visit the [Overview page](../how/overview.mdx). To learn how to create a template, follow the [template guide](./template.mdx). To see an example of a Warp job and condition without a template, visit the [from-scratch example guide](./example.mdx).

## Prerequisites

Complete the following before creating a job:

- Download Google Chrome
- Install [the Station Chrome Extension](https://docs..money/learn/station/download/station-extension)

## Connect your wallet and create an account

1. Sign in to your Station wallet using the [Station Browser Extension](https://setup-station.terra.money/). 

2. To connect your wallet to Warp, click the wallet icon in the bottom left corner of the Warp app screen. 

3. Select **Station Wallet**. 

4. If needed, click **approve** in the Station extension.

Before proceeding, understand that you will need to sign a transaction with your wallet to set up your Warp account.

Warp accounts allow jobs to have access to funds that they can transact with. Before you can create a job, you'll need to make an account.

5. Click **Create account** and sign the transaction by inputting your password on the Station Browser Extension. 

6. Click on the icon of the interlinked circles to view your account balance. Deposit some funds into your Warp account to use in jobs or to pay for execution rewards. 

You are now connected to your Warp account. Before you continue, make sure you are using the [correct network](https://docs.terra.money/learn/station/networks).

## Create a job using a premade template

[Templates](template.mdx) help make jobs reusable and easier to create. Use the following steps to create a job from a premade template. 

1. On the left menu, click the "**+**" symbol to open the creation menu. 

2. Select **Job** and then select **Basic mode**. 

3. Enter a job name and select a template from the **Template** dropdown. 

4. Enter values into the required fields and specify a reward for execution. 

5. Double-check your inputs and click **Save**.

6. Sign the transaction using the Station extension.

Congratulations, you've just created a job!

## Create a template

Follow the [template creation guide](template.mdx) to learn how to make a limit order template. 

## Create a job from scratch

<Admonition type="tip" icon="💡" title="Job example">

For a hands-on example of a Warp job and condition, visit the [Example page](example.mdx).

</Admonition>

1. On the left menu, click the "**+**" symbol to open the creation menu. 

2. Select **Job** and then select **Advanced mode**. 

3. Enter a Job Name, a Reward for executing the job, and a Job message. This message can be any WASM message that you want to execute. Remember that you will need to add funds to your account before you can transact them in a job message. Be sure that your reward amount is more than the gas cost of the message. 

4.  Click **Next**. 

5. Create a [condition](../how/condition.mdx) using the interface. Click the **+** symbol to add a condition. For complex conditions, select a boolean operator such as **And**, **Or**, or **Not**. For single expressions, select **Expression**. 

<Admonition type="tip" icon="📝" title="Writing conditions">

Visit the [Conditions and expressions](../how/condition.mdx) page to learn how conditions work. You can also follow the [exampleexample.mdxmple.mdx) to learn how to create a job message and condition.

</Admonition>

6. Select an [Expression type](../how/condition.mdx) to specify the conditions of when your job should be executed. The time input can be human-readable, such as "next Saturday at 8:00 pm." All times are in UTC. 

    - Timestamp expressions require a time and a less than (lt) or greater than( gt) operator. 
    - Blockheight expressions require a height as well as [number operator](../how/condition.mdx#number-operators). 
    - [Booleans, decimal, integer, or string expressions](../how/condition.mdx) can be written using simple or [query inputs](../how/query.mdx).
    - Queries require a name, a [query message](../how/query.mdx), and a [selector](../how/query.mdx#selectors). 

7. After writing your condition, click **Save** and sign your job submission using Station. 

Congratulations! You just created a job! When the conditions have been met, a keeper will execute your job and claim their reward.
