## Jobs
<CH.Scrollycoding>

### CreateJobMsg

Creates a job using a name, [condition](../how/condition.mdx), execute messages, a reward, and other properties. Jobs are stored in an index. Successfully created jobs are given the _`Pending`_ status. Jobs can also contain a _`create_job`_ transactions, allowing jobs to be chained together and executed from the same context. 


```rust Rust
pub struct Job {
    // unique identifier for each Job
    pub id: Uint64,
    // job creator address
    pub owner: Addr,
    // UTC timestamp for when the Job was submitted
    pub last_update_time: Uint64,
    // name given to the Job
    pub name: String,
    // a description of the Job
    pub description: String,
    // a label for the Job
    pub labels: Vec<String>,
    // status of the Job (pending, executed, failed, canceled)
    pub status: JobStatus,
    // condition set dictating when the Job should be executed
    pub condition: Condition,
    // a Job message to be executed when the conditions are met
    pub msgs: Vec<String>,
    // variables to be used in a condition or Job message
    pub vars: Vec<Variable>,
    // whether the Job is recurring
    pub recurring: bool,
    // whether to requeue the Job after being evicted
    pub requeue_on_evict: bool,
    // reward to distribute to the keeper when the Job has been executed
    pub reward: Uint128,
    // assets that can be withdrawn back to the account after Job completion
    pub assets_to_withdraw: Vec<AssetInfo>,
}
```

### DeleteJobMsg

Allows the Job owner to delete a pending job. Deleted Job messages are still stored in the index and given a _`Canelled`_ status. 

```rust Rust
pub struct DeleteJobMsg {
    pub id: Uint64,
}
```

---

### UpdateJobMsg

Allows the job owner to update Job properties or add more rewards. 

```rust Rust
pub struct UpdateJobMsg {
    pub id: Uint64,
    pub name: Option<String>,
    pub description: Option<String>,
    pub labels: Option<Vec<String>>,
    pub added_reward: Option<Uint128>,
}
```

---

### ExecuteJobMsg

Allows a keeper to execute a pending job if the conditions are met. Upon execution of the job, the reward will be released to the keeper. External inputs can be specified for Job execution. 

```rust Rust
pub struct ExecuteJobMsg {
    pub id: Uint64,
    pub external_inputs: Option<Vec<ExternalInput>>,
}

pub struct ExternalInput {
    pub name: String,
    pub input: String,
}

```

### EvictJobMsg

[Evict](../how/overview.mdx#eviction) jobs in the queue and collect a 5% eviction fee. 

```rust Rust
pub struct EvictJobMsg {
    pub id: Uint64,
}
```

## Accounts

<CH.Scrollycoding>

### CreateAccountMsg

Create a Warp account. Warp accounts can be created with funds. You can also create an account, create a Job, and fund the account all in one message using [_`CreateJobMsg`_](#jobs).

```rust Rust
pub struct CreateAccountMsg {
    pub funds: Option<Vec<Fund>>,
}
```

</CH.Scrollycoding>


## Config

<CH.Scrollycoding>

### UpdateConfigMsg

Update the config message for Warp configuration. 

```rust Rust
pub struct UpdateConfigMsg {
    pub owner: Option<String>,
    pub fee_collector: Option<String>,
    pub minimum_reward: Option<Uint128>,
    pub creation_fee_percentage: Option<Uint64>,
    pub cancellation_fee_percentage: Option<Uint64>,
    pub template_fee: Option<Uint128>,
    pub t_max: Option<Uint64>,
    pub t_min: Option<Uint64>,
    pub a_max: Option<Uint128>,
    pub a_min: Option<Uint128>,
    pub q_max: Option<Uint64>,
}
```
