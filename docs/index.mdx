# Warp Docs

Warp is an open-source, [decentralized event handler](./how/overview.mdx) for the [Terra ecosystem](https://terra.money), allowing users to place arbitrary messages in a queue to be executed whenever a specific set of conditions is met. These messages are called [jobs](./how/overview.mdx), and they can be anything from basic send transactions to complicated multi-step arbitrage transactions. Users can specify a set of circumstances called [conditions](./how/overview.mdx#conditions) under which a job can be executed. Conditions can be simple, such as a blockheight, or complex, combing multiple expressions into a composite web of specificity. Included with a job message is a reward for execution. Once a condition is met, [anyone](./how/overview.mdx#keepers) can execute the job and claim their [reward](./how/overview.mdx#rewards). Using a decentralized system of smart-contract-controlled parameters and reward-incentivized keepers, Warp unlocks the future of blockchain automation.
