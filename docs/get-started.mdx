# â†’ Get started

Follow this guide to create an account and start writing jobs and conditions. For more general information on how Warp works, visit the [Overview page](./how/overview.mdx). To see an example of a Warp job and condition, visit the [Example page](./guides/example.mdx).


## Prerequisites

Complete the following before creating a job:

- Download Google Chrome
- Install [the Station Chrome Extension](https://docs..money/learn/station/download/station-extension)

## Connect your wallet to Warp

1. Sign in to your Station wallet using the [Station Browser Extension](https://setup-station.terra.money/). 

2. To connect your wallet to Warp, click the wallet icon in the bottom left corner of the Warp app screen. 

3. Select **Station Wallet**. 

4. If needed, click **approve** in the Station extension. 

You are now connected to your wallet. Before you continue, make sure you are using the [correct network](https://docs.terra.money/learn/station/networks).

## Create an account

Warp accounts allow jobs to have access to funds that they can transact with. Before you can create a job, you'll need to make an account. 

1. On the left menu, click on the third icon from the top. It should look like two interlocked circles.

Before proceeding, understand that you will need to sign a transaction with your wallet to set up your Warp account.

2. Click **Create account** and sign the transaction by inputting your password on the Station Browser Extension. 


3. Deposit some funds into your Warp account to use in jobs or pay for execution rewards. 

## Create a job

<Admonition type="tip" title="Job example">

For a hands-on example of a Warp job and condition, visit the [Example page](guides/example.mdx).

</Admonition>

1. On the left menu, click on the second icon from the top to take you to the job page. 

2. On the right side of the screen, click the **+ New** button.

3. Enter a Job Name, a Reward for executing the job, and a Job message. This message can be any WASM message that you want to execute. Remember that you will need to add funds to your account before you can transact them in a job message. Be sure that your reward amount is more than the gas cost of the message. 

4.  Click **Next**. 

5. Create a [condition](./how/condition.mdx) using the interface. Click the **+** symbol to add a condition. For complex conditions, select a boolean operator such as **And**, **Or**, or **Not**. For single expressions, select **Expression**.

Visit the [Conditions and expressions](./how/condition.mdx) page to learn how conditions work. 

</Admonition>

6. Select an [Expression type](./how/condition.mdx) to specify the conditions of when your job should be executed. The time input can be human-readable, such as "next Saturday at 8:00 pm." All times are in UTC. 

    - Timestamp expressions require a time and a less than (lt) or greater than( gt) operator. 
    - Blockheight expressions require a height as well as [number operator](./how/condition.mdx#number-operators). 
    - [Booleans, decimal, integer, or string expressions](how/condition.mdx) can be written using simple or [query inputs](./how/query.mdx).
    - Queries require a name, a [query message](./how/query.mdx), and a [selector](./how/query.mdx#selectors). 

7. After writing your condition, click **Save** and sign your job submission using Station. 

Congratulations! You just created a job! When the conditions have been met, a keeper will execute your job and claim their reward.
